# boxing-sim
a simple boxing "simulation" i made a while ago in java script <br>

# how to use:
  you can make new characters by inputing into the console: `let [name] = new character( [name], [strength], [speed], [agility], [HP])`
  you can start a fight by inputing into the console: `fight( [fighter1], [fighter1])`
